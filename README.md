# Picture-in-Picture
This project demonstrates how to implement Picture-in-Picture functionality in a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The project consists of an HTML page with a video element and a button. When the button is clicked, the web application prompts the user to select a media stream, which in this case is the user's display. The selected media stream is then passed to the video element, and the video is played. Additionally, the application provides a button to activate the Picture-in-Picture mode for the video.
