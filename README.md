## Description
The project consists of an HTML page with a video element and a button. When the button is clicked, the web application prompts the user to select a media stream, which in this case is the user's display. The selected media stream is then passed to the video element, and the video is played. Additionally, the application provides a button to activate the Picture-in-Picture mode for the video.

## Features
- Select and display the user's screen as a video stream.
- Play the selected video stream in the web application.
- Enable Picture-in-Picture mode for the video.
